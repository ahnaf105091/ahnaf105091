## About Me

---
I'm a beginner data analyst testing the waters of data analytics, hoping to get into sports analytics one day. 

So far I'm playing around with football manager datasets to implement in my game saves.

You can check out some of my works 

Please see my [Football_analytics](https://github.com/ahnaf105091/Football-analytics) repository for a collection of football analytics projects, data, and analysis that I have created, with links to publicly available resources in the football analytics community.
